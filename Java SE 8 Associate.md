 #### 1. Java Basic
    - Define the scope of variables
    - Define the structure of Java class
    - Create executable Java applications with a main method
    - Import other Java packages to make them accesible in you code 

 #### 2. Working with Java Data Types
    - Declarate and initialize variables
    - Differentable between object reference variables and primitive variables
    - Read or write to object fields
    - Explain an ObjectÂ´s Lifecycle (creation, "diference" and garbage collection)
    - Call methods on objects
    - Manipulate data using the StringBuilder class and its methods 
    - Creating and manipulating Strings

#### 3. Using Operators and Desicion Contructs
    - Use Java operators
    - Use parenthesis to override operator procedence
    - Test equality between String and other objects using == and equals ()
    - Create if and if/else contructs
    - Use a swicth statement
    
#### 4. Creating and Using Arrays 
    - Declare, instantiate, initialize and use one-dimensional array
    - Declare, instantiate, initialize and use multi-dimensional array
    - Declare and use an ArrayList
    
#### 5. Using Loop Contructs
    - Create and use while loops
    - Create and use for loops including the enhanced for loop
    - Create and use do/while loops
    - Compare loops contructs
    - Use break and continue

#### 6. Working with Methods and Encapsulation
    - Create methods with arguments and return values
    - Apply the static keyword to methods and fields 
    - Create an overloader methods
    - Difference between default and user defined constructors 
    - Create and overload contructors
    - Apply encapsulation principles to a class
    - Determine the effect upon object references and primitive values when they are passed into methods that change the values
    
#### 7. Working with Inheritance
    - Implement inheritance
    - Develop code taht demostrates the use of polymorphism
    - Differentiate between the type of reference and the type of an object
    - Determine when casting is necessary
    - Use super and this to access objects and contructors
    - Use abstract classes and interfaces
    
#### 8. Handling Exceptions
    - Differentiate among checked exceptions, Runtime Exceptions and Errors
    - Create a try-catch block and determine how exceptions alter normal program flow
    - Describe what Exceptions are used for in Java
    - Invoke a method that throws an exception
    - Recognize common exception classes and categories
    
# ðŸš€ New Features in Java 8 ðŸš€

#### Java Basic
    - Run a java program from the command line; including console output
    - Compare and contrast the features and components of Java such as: plataform independence, object orientation, encapsulation, etc.
        - Working with Java Data Types
        - Develop code that uses wrapper classes such sa Boolean, Double, and Integer.
        - Working with Selected Clases from the Java API
    - Create and manipulate calendar data using classes from java.time.LocalDateTime, java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter, java.time.Period.
    - Write a simple Lamnda expression that consumes a Lambda Predicate expression 
    
## Scope of variables ðŸ¤©
```java
public void m1(){    //Method opeing
   int x = 10;       //Method local variable
}                   //Method cloding       
```
